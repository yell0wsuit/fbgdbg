# fbgdbg - Facebook Gradient Background

The gradient background from Facebook Accounts Center.

This repo contains the HTML code and CSS values of the background with some minor tweaks.

There are two versions for this theme: Static (non-animated) and Animated. The animated background code is already implemented, however it seems to be unused due to missing the ``animation-duration`` property. Feel free to experiment any animations that suit your style.
